# Hi, I'm Hanie 👋 — I empower decisions through data

I’m a Sydney-based M.C Business Analytics graduate with a passion for uncovering insights and transforming raw data into real business value.

With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience across **healthcare, fintech, and entertainment platforms**, I’ve contributed to digital transformations, reduced operational risks, and delivered insights from millions of records. 

My academic journey at Macquarie University has been equally rewarding: earning two 1st-place awards for building big data pipelines and delivering strategic recommendations to SnowyHydro on Australia's energy market.

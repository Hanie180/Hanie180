# Hi, I'm Hanie 👋 

I’m a Sydney-based **Data & Insights Analyst** specialising in **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** and **hospital operations**. Over the past year, I’ve **analysed revenue**, **billing**, and **patient activity data** across multiple sites to **uncover leakage**, **optimise workflows**, and help finance teams make more confident, data-driven decisions.

My work blends technical skills with practical impact: **forecasting unbilled revenue**, **building automated KPI dashboards**, and **improving the discharge-to-bill cycle** through clear, actionable insights.

I’m passionate about building tools, dashboards, and models that make healthcare more efficient, sustainable, and transparent.
Let’s build meaningful things together. 🚀

## 🏥 Healthcare & RCM Focus

I’ve worked closely with **finance**, **clinical**, and **operational teams** to translate business questions into actionable insights that **improve hospital performance**. This includes:

- **Specialising in RCM** with experience analysing **hospital revenue**, **billing accuracy**, **unbilled charges**, **payor trends**, **DRG groupings**, and **aged debt** across **200+ hospital sites**.
- **Modelling patient flow and unbilled revenue with >90% accuracy**, enabling proactive cash flow planning and early identification of billing risks.
- Delivering **real-time visibility of payor trends**, **aged debtor categories**, and **DRG performance**, supporting finance teams in understanding variation and leakage.
- **Reducing manual reporting time by 40%** through automated **Power BI dashboards**, integrating data from **SQL server, Meditech, TM1**, and other hospital systems.

My goal is always the same: **make healthcare more efficient**, **financially sustainable**, and **easier to navigate** for the people working in it.

## 🛠️ Technical Strengths

## 🎓 Academic Foundation & Selected Projects

I hold a Master of Business Analytics from Macquarie University, awarded for Academic Excellence, Highest Achiever in Big Data, and Industry Case Competition Winner (judged by SnowyHydro). My studies strengthened my grounding in statistics, machine learning, big data processing, and graph analytics — capabilities I now apply directly to healthcare reporting and performance insights.

Selected Projects:

NEM Energy Forecasting: Built ML models (Random Forest, Neural Networks, AdaBoost) to forecast national electricity demand.

Airline Customer Segmentation: Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering for targeted behavioural segmentation.

Olympic Medals Big Data Analysis: Designed a MapReduce pipeline to process and rank athletes across large-scale datasets.

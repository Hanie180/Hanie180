# Hi, I'm Hanie 👋 

I’m a Sydney-based **Data & Insights Analyst** specialising in **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** and **hospital operations**. Over the past year, I’ve **analysed revenue**, **billing**, and **patient activity data** across multiple sites to **uncover leakage**, **optimise workflows**, and help finance teams make more confident, data-driven decisions.

My work blends technical skills with practical impact: **forecasting unbilled revenue**, **building automated KPI dashboards**, and **improving the discharge-to-bill cycle** through clear, actionable insights.

I’m passionate about building tools, dashboards, and models that make healthcare more efficient, sustainable, and transparent.
Let’s build meaningful things together. 🚀

## 🏥 Healthcare & RCM Focus

I’ve worked closely with **finance**, **clinical**, and **operational teams** to translate business questions into actionable insights that **improve hospital performance**. This includes:

- **Specialising in RCM** with experience analysing **hospital revenue**, **billing accuracy**, **unbilled charges**, **payor trends**, **DRG groupings**, and **aged debt** across **200+ hospital sites**.
- **Modelling patient flow and unbilled revenue with >90% accuracy**, enabling proactive cash flow planning and early identification of billing risks.
- Delivering **real-time visibility of payor trends**, **aged debtor categories**, and **DRG performance**, supporting finance teams in understanding variation and leakage.
- **Reducing manual reporting time by 40%** through automated **Power BI dashboards**, integrating data from **SQL server, Meditech, TM1**, and other hospital systems.

My goal is always the same: **make healthcare more efficient**, **financially sustainable**, and **easier to navigate** for the people working in it.

## 🛠️ Technical Strengths

- **Advanced Analytics & Modelling** :
**Proficient in Python, SQL, and DAX**, building **predictive models**, time-intelligence measures, and scalable data workflows for **unbilled revenue forecasting**, **patient flow**, and **RCM performance insights**.

- **Business Intelligence & Reporting** :
Experienced in developing **automated, performance-optimised Power BI dashboards** with strong data models and KPI logic, integrating datasets from **SQL, Meditech, TM1, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake**.

- **Data Storytelling & Healthcare Insighting** :
Skilled at transforming complex hospital, billing, and operational data into clear, actionable insights for finance, clinical, and operational leaders — ensuring analytics directly supports decisions that improve hospital performance.

- End-to-end analytics development — from data cleaning, modelling, and validation to predictive modelling and dashboard design for healthcare decision-making.
- Proficient in Python, SQL, and DAX (Power BI), applying advanced calculations, time-intelligence logic, and complex data transformations to support RCM reporting and forecasting.
- Skilled in building automated Power BI solutions with robust data models, KPI structures, and performance-optimised measures used across finance and operational teams.
- Experienced in working with Meditech, TM1, Google BigQuery, integrating multi-source hospital datasets into scalable BI products.
- Strong foundation in predictive analytics and machine learning (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Neural Networks, clustering), used to model unbilled revenue risk, patient flow, and operational performance trends.



## 🎓 Academic Foundation

I hold a Master of Business Analytics (High Distinction) from Macquarie University, with awards for academic excellence and industry case competitions judged by SnowyHydro. My studies strengthened my capability in machine learning, big data processing, graph analytics, and statistical modelling — skills I now apply directly to healthcare operations and financial performance.

## 📚 Projects & Interests

Whether modelling unbilled revenue risk, improving workflow efficiency, or designing KPI dashboards, I enjoy the challenge of turning noisy, messy data into solutions that make healthcare more efficient and patient-centred.

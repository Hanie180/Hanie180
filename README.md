# Hi, I'm Hanie 👋 I turn complex healthcare data into clarity and better decisions.

I’m a Sydney-based Data & Insights Analyst specialising in Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) and hospital operations. Over the past year, I’ve analysed revenue, billing, and patient activity data across multiple sites to uncover leakage, optimise workflows, and help finance teams make more confident, data-driven decisions.

My work blends technical skills with practical impact: forecasting unbilled revenue, building automated KPI dashboards, and improving the discharge-to-bill cycle through clear, actionable insights.

## 💼 What I Do

I analyse hospital revenue, billing, and patient activity across multiple sites to bring transparency to complex RCM processes. My recent work includes:

🏥 Identifying revenue leakage and fund-level performance variation

📈 Forecasting unbilled revenue and patient flow with >90% accuracy

⚡ Automating Power BI dashboards that cut manual reporting by 40%

🤝 Partnering with finance, operations, and clinical teams to accelerate the discharge-to-bill cycle

My goal is always the same: make healthcare more efficient, financially sustainable, and easier to navigate for the people working in it.

## 🧠 Technical Strengths

I design analytics solutions end-to-end — from raw data to predictive models to polished dashboards.

Languages: Python, SQL, DAX, R
Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Excel, TM1, Studio 3T
Platforms: Google Cloud, BigQuery, Snowflake, MySQL
Methods: RCM analytics, unbilled revenue modelling, DRG analysis, forecasting, machine learning, KPI dashboards, data governance

## 🌱 How I Work

🎯 Structured thinker who turns ambiguity into clear steps

🗣️ Strong at translating complex data into insights stakeholders actually use

🤝 Collaborative across finance, clinical, and operational teams

🔄 Always learning, especially in healthcare systems and scalable analytics

## 🎓 Academic Foundation

Master of Business Analytics (High Distinction) — Macquarie University

🏆 Winner, Industry Case Competition (SnowyHydro judges)

🏅 Highest Achiever in Big Data

🔬 Built machine learning models, big data pipelines, and graph analytics projects now applied directly to my work in healthcare

## 📚 Projects & Interests

I enjoy solving operational challenges with data — from modelling unbilled revenue risk to designing KPI dashboards, improving workflow efficiency, and analysing payor trends and DRG performance.

If it has messy data and real-world impact, I’m there.

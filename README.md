# Hi, I'm Hanie 👋 I turn complex healthcare data into clarity and better decisions.

I’m a Sydney-based Data & Insights Analyst specialising in Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) and hospital operations. Over the past year, I’ve analysed revenue, billing, and patient activity data across multiple sites to uncover leakage, optimise workflows, and help finance teams make more confident, data-driven decisions.

My work blends technical skills with practical impact: forecasting unbilled revenue, building automated KPI dashboards, and improving the discharge-to-bill cycle through clear, actionable insights.

## 🏥 Healthcare & RCM Focus

I’ve worked closely with finance, clinical, and operational teams to improve transparency, accuracy, and efficiency across the RCM process. This includes:

- Analysing fund performance variation and billing inconsistencies across hospitals
- Modelling patient flow and unbilled revenue with >90% accuracy
- Providing real-time visibility of payor trends, aged debt, and DRG category performance
- Reducing manual reporting time by 40% through automated Power BI builds

My goal is always the same: make healthcare more efficient, financially sustainable, and easier to navigate for the people working in it.

## 🧠 Technical Strengths

I design analytics solutions end-to-end — from cleaning and modelling data to building predictive models and visual dashboards.
My core toolkit includes Python, SQL, DAX (Power BI), R, TM1, BigQuery, and Snowflake, with experience integrating FinBI, Meditech, and TM1 datasets.

## 🌱 What I Bring

I combine structured analytical thinking with a strong stakeholder lens, translating complex datasets into insights clinicians, finance managers, and operational leaders can act on. My background in customer support has shaped my strength in communication, clarity, and cross-functional collaboration.

## 🎓 Academic Foundation

I hold a Master of Business Analytics (High Distinction) from Macquarie University, with awards for academic excellence and industry case competitions judged by SnowyHydro. My studies strengthened my capability in machine learning, big data processing, graph analytics, and statistical modelling — skills I now apply directly to healthcare operations and financial performance.

## 📚 Projects & Interests

Whether modelling unbilled revenue risk, improving workflow efficiency, or designing KPI dashboards, I enjoy the challenge of turning noisy, messy data into solutions that make healthcare more efficient and patient-centred.
